# Food-Hub
On this project, I focused on communicating the insights from the data. Please the PDF presentation of the insights.
● Many students and professionals opt for online food delivery services for their meals due to their 
busy lifestyles. Food Hub is an online hub that provides food delivery services where customers 
can place orders from restaurants on the Food Hub platform and get the food delivered to them 
within New York. 
● With the increasing number of restaurants in the New York and online food delivery service 
customer satisfaction is important. To improve customer experience and service, Food Hub must 
understand the demand for different restaurants, cuisine types, order delivery time and data 
relating to times of the week with the most orders on the Food Hub online platform.
● Therefore, data related to food orders was analysed to first of all understand the data structure, 
determined the preferred restaurants that customers usually order their meals, evaluated the total 
time taken for customers to receive their meals after placing orders in a bid to finding gaps and 
tailored solutions for improvement.
● Since ratings reflect customer satisfaction, ratings were compared with cuisine type, restaurants, 
order delivery time, food preparation time, and cost of the order to determine the level of customer 
satisfaction.
● The relationship between the cost of the order, food preparation time, and delivery time is evaluated 
to determine their relationships to see how improvement in one can affect another.
● Determine which cuisine types take the most time to get prepared.
● Using the cost of orders, determine the total revenue that Food Hub will make from order delivery 
charges.
● Determine which restaurants meet the requirements for promotional offers to support the 
restaurants with promotional adverts to users.
● Finally, the mean total delivery time on weekdays and weekends is compared to determine which is 
faster.
